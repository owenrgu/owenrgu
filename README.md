# 👋 Hi, I'm Owen! 
I'm an 18 year old software engineer interested in programming and videogames. I am experienced with the Luau programming language, and am currently learning JavaScript and Java at university. 🖥️

I'm currently in my second year studying BSc Computer Science at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland. When I graduate university, I aspire to continue working on my existing game dev startup and continue pursuing my interests in software engineering. 🌱

I'd love to talk about games and programming. Reach out to me at my university email: [o.meade@rgu.ac.uk](mailto:o.meade@rgu.ac.uk) or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/owen-jm)! 📫

See my pinned repositories below for some of the open-source work I've done to compliment my projects at university. 👇
